Trader Destockifier
Tired of traders being legal spawners? This mod might be for you.

Introducing Trader Destockifier: very simple mod that limits the amount of items each trader can have in stock at the time of restock

The mod comes with MCM options to adjust those values.

If you combine the mod with other's, which alters loot for example Outfit Chance to Drop, you can get pretty interesting change in gameplay mechanics

The mod is compatible with everything. It uses artifax's Trader Autoinject script to manipulate trader's assortment. Don't worry if you see conflicts in MO2 for this file, its the same across all mods
